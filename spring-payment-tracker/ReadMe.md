# spring-payment-tracker.

This project shows the use of two tables (customers, payments) that are located on the MYSQL server.
There are initially several types of users:
EMPLOYEE - user: john password: test123
MANAGER - user: ruby password: test123
ADMIN - user: arye password: test123

file scriptsql in: src/main/webapp/resources/sql

IN MySql
user=springstudent
password=springstudent

I've used:
- Spring MVC and Hibernate CRUD app
- Spring Java Config
- Spring Security
- Maven
- filter utf-8
- JSP
- Bootstramp4, JQuery

The project is based on the things I learned in the courses:

Spring & Hibernate for Beginners - https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/v4/overview

The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 - https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overview
